# Lab Work 09-1. Double Hashing

*Note. Programming in C++, including <iostream>/<iostream.h>, <cstdlib>/<cstdlib.h> and <cmath>/<math.h> only* 

Consider a hash table with M = 64 bins. Given a 24-bit unsigned number, take the lowest 6 bits as the primary hash function (bin number), and the highest 6 bits as the secondary hash function (jump size).

* Determine the array structures for a hash table
* Hash a list of 32 random 24-bit positive numbers
* Calculate the average number of probes
