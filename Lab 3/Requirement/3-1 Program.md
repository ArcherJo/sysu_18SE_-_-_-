# Lab Work 03-1. Application of Lists and Stacks

*Note. Programming in C++, including <iostream>/<iostream.h> and <cstdlib>/<cstdlib.h> only*

* Let n be a positive integer with specified initial value n=30. Use an array of n units to store polynomial of one indeterminate. Design and implement a C++ program to

* Determine the data structure of the array
* Use a stack **S** in the array to store unused units. Initially all the units are unused and the 0 to (n-1) indexes are spreaded randomly on the stack
* Use two linked lists **LP** and **LQ** in the array to store two polynomial of one indeterminates **P** and **Q**
* Show the map of the array
* Adding **P** and **Q**, restore the result as a linked list **LPQ** in the array, and release all garbage units to the stack **S**
* Show the map of the array again
