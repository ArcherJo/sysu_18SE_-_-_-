# Lab Work 10-1. Implementation of Topological Sorting

*Note. Programming in C++, including <iostream>/<iostream.h>, <cstdlib>/<cstdlib.h> and <cmath>/<math.h> only* 

Refer to the example of digraph and data structures in Lecture 22, slide 45.

* Represent the digraph with an Adjacency List
* Determine the data structures for the process of improved topological sorting
* Design a C/C++ program implementing the improved topological sorting.
