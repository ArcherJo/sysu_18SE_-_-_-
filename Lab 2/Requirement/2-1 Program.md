# Lab Work 02-1. Comparisons of Different Complexity Classes

*Note. Programming in C++, including <iostream>/<iostream.h> and <cmath>/<math.h> only* 

* Let n be a positive integer with specified initial value.

* Design and implement a C++ program to find the least number N such that g(n)>=f(n) when n>N.

1. n=1, f(n)=n and g(n)=nln(n)
2. n=1, f(n)=n^10 and g(n)=2^n
3. n=2, f(n)=n^10 and g(n)=n!
4. n=2, f(n)=10^n and g(n)=n!
