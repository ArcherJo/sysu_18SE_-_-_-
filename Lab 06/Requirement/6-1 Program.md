# Lab Work 06-1. Array Implemetation of min-Heaps

*Note. Programming in C++, including <iostream>/<iostream.h>, <cstdlib>/<cstdlib.h> and <cmath>/<math.h> only* 

A complete min-heap is a min-heap with the structure of a complete binary tree which can be stored using an array.

* Determine the array structures for a complete min-heap
* Input a linear list of 20 random numbers, building a complete min-heap to store the numbers
* Implement POP and PUSH operations for the min-heaps.
