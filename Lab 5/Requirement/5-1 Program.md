# Lab Work 05-1. Balance Rotations of AVL Trees

*Note. Programming in C++, including <iostream>/<iostream.h>, <cstdlib>/<cstdlib.h> and <cmath>/<math.h> only* 

An AVL tree is a binary search tree where every node in the tree has a balance factor of -1, 0 or +1. But any insertion into the AVL tree may cause violations of balance in four cases: Left-Left, Left-Right, Right-Right, and Right-Left. Single Rotations and Double Rotations are introduced to fix these cases.

* Determine the data structures for an AVL tree
* Implement an insertion into the AVL tree
* Implement the four possible rotations to fix violations of balance caused by the insertion.
