# Lab Work 04-1. Application of Binary Trees

*Note. Programming in C++, including <iostream>/<iostream.h>, <cstdlib>/<cstdlib.h> and <cmath>/<math.h> only* 

A left-child-right-sibling binary tree (LCRS) is a binary tree used to store a general rooted ordered tree by the following consideration:

* The first child of each node is its left sub-tree in LCRS
* The next sibling of each node is its right sub-tree in LCRS

The transformation of a general rooted ordered tree into a LCRS binary tree has been called the Knuth transform

* Determine the data structures for general rooted ordered trees and binary trees
* Implement the Knuth transform in C/C++
* Show by examples that a post-order traversal of the original tree is identical to the in-order traversal of the Knuth transform
