# Lab Work 11-1. Implementation of Kruskal Algorithm

*Note. Programming in C++, including <iostream>/<iostream.h>, <cstdlib>/<cstdlib.h> and <cmath>/<math.h> only* 

Refer to the example of graph and data structures in Lecture 23, slide 92.

* Represent the digraph with an Adjacency List
* Determine the data structures for the process of improved Kruskal algorithm
* Design a C/C++ program implementing the improved Kruskal algorithm.
