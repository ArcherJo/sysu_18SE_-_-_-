# Lab Work 07-1. In-place Heap Sorting

*Note. Programming in C++, including <iostream>/<iostream.h>, <cstdlib>/<cstdlib.h> and <cmath>/<math.h> only* 

* Determine the array structures for a complete max-heap
* Input a linear list of 20 random numbers, building a complete max-heap to store the numbers by the process of in-place heapification
* Implement an in-place sorting, making use of POP operation for the built complete max-heaps .
